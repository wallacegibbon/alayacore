# Architecture

AlayaCore follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns. The layers communicate via a lightweight TLV (Tag-Length-Value) binary protocol.

## Components

### Entry Point (`main.go`, `internal/config/`, `internal/app/`)

The entry point wires together all components:

1. **`config.Parse()`** — Parses CLI flags into `config.Settings`
2. **`app.Setup()`** — Initializes shared components:
   - Skills manager (loads skill metadata from `--skill` directories)
   - Tools (`read_file`, `edit_file`, `write_file`, `execute_command`, and conditionally `search_content`)
   - System prompt (default + skills section/fragment when configured + current working directory)
3. **Adaptor creation** — Starts either the terminal or PlainIO adaptor

### Adaptors Layer (`internal/adaptors/`)

The adaptor layer handles user interaction and translates between user actions and the TLV protocol.

#### Terminal Adaptor (`internal/adaptors/terminal/`)

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Terminal` | Main Bubble Tea model composing all UI components |
| `DisplayModel` | Renders assistant output with virtual scrolling. See [virtual-rendering-performance.md](virtual-rendering-performance.md). |
| `InputModel` | Handles user text input with external editor support. See [external-editor-windowsize.md](external-editor-windowsize.md). |
| `ModelSelector` | Modal for switching between AI models |
| `QueueManager` | Modal for managing the task queue |
| `ThemeSelector` | Modal for switching between color themes |
| `OutputWriter` | Parses TLV from session and renders styled content |
| `WindowBuffer` | Virtual scrolling buffer for display windows |
| `Theme` | Customizable color scheme (Catppuccin Mocha default) |

#### PlainIO Adaptor (`internal/adaptors/plainio/`)

Plain stdin/stdout mode, activated with `--plainio`. Shows assistant text, reasoning, and tool call headers. Suppresses tool result content. Reads prompts from stdin (one per line, backslash continuation for multi-line prompts).

#### File Naming Convention

Files in the adaptor packages are named from the **session's perspective**:

- **`input.go`** — builds the **input to the session**. Reads user data (keystrokes, stdin lines) and feeds it into the session's input channel via TLV-encoded messages.
- **`output.go`** — handles the **output from the session**. Receives TLV messages from the session and renders them to the user (TUI windows, stdout).

```
User IO ──▶ input.go ──▶ input channel ──▶ Session ──▶ output.go ──▶ User IO
             ("input to                       ("output from
              the session")                    the session")
```

Both adaptors follow this convention. Each adaptor provides its own implementation of how user IO maps to and from the session's TLV channels.

### Session Layer (`internal/agent/`)

The session layer manages conversation state, task execution, and model interaction.

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Session` | Main struct managing conversation state and message history |
| `Task Queue` | FIFO queue for pending prompts and commands |
| `ModelManager` | Loads and manages AI model configurations from `model.conf`. Never writes to the file. |
| `RuntimeManager` | Persists runtime settings (active model, active theme) to `runtime.conf` |
| `CommandRegistry` | Declarative registration of session commands (`:save`, `:cancel`, etc.) |
| `ContextTokens` | Tracks conversation context size across API calls. See [context-tracking.md](context-tracking.md). |
| `compactHistory()` | Truncates old tool results to save context. Configurable via `--compact-keep-steps` and `--compact-truncate-len`. |

### Session Persistence

- **Auto-save** — Always enabled when `--session` is specified. The session is saved after each step completes.
- **Manual save** — `:save [file]` or `Ctrl+S` at any time (TUI mode).
- **Load** — On startup, AlayaCore starts a new empty session unless you specify `--session` to load an existing one.
- **Auto-summarize** — When `--auto-summarize` is enabled and `context_limit` is set, AlayaCore automatically triggers `:summarize` when context reaches 65% of the limit.

Session files use a Markdown-based format with YAML frontmatter. The body contains TLV-encoded conversation data (messages, tool calls, tool results) written directly as binary TLV records after the frontmatter.

### Truncation (`internal/truncation/`)

Shared text truncation utilities used by the tools and session layers. All functions guarantee valid UTF-8 output (no split multi-byte characters). Two strategies:

| Function | Strategy | Used by |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `Lines` | Keeps first N non-empty lines | `search_content` (100 lines default) |
| `Front` | Keeps front of text within byte budget | `execute_command` (32KB limit), `compactHistory` (configurable length) |

All strategies use a unified `[truncated]` marker so the LLM can recognize truncated output regardless of source. `Front` uses a byte budget and counts each rune's actual byte cost, so any mix of ASCII and multi-byte characters (CJK, emoji) is handled fairly without approximation.

### Agent Layer (`internal/llm/`)

The agent layer handles LLM interaction and tool-calling orchestration.

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Agent` | Tool-calling loop orchestration with configurable max steps |
| `Provider` interface | Streaming LLM abstraction with callback-based event handling |
| `Factory` | Creates the correct provider based on `protocol_type` |
| `Providers` | Anthropic and OpenAI implementations |
| `TypedExecute` | Type-safe tool execution via Go generics |
| `GenerateSchema` | Auto-generates JSON schemas from struct tags |

**Key pattern — Callback Streaming:**

```go
Agent.Stream(ctx, messages, llm.StreamCallbacks{
	OnTextDelta:      func(delta string) error { ... },
	OnReasoningDelta: func(delta string) error { ... },
	OnToolCall:       func(id, name string, input json.RawMessage) error { ... },
	OnToolResult:     func(id string, output ToolResultOutput) error { ... },
	OnStepStart:      func(step int) error { ... },
	OnStepFinish:     func(msgs []Message, usage Usage) error { ... },
})
```

Messages are appended incrementally in `OnStepFinish` so they're preserved even if the user cancels.

### Tools Layer (`internal/tools/`)

| Tool | Description | Safety | Dependency |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| `read_file` | Read file contents with optional line ranges. 32KB max for full reads. | Safe | — |
| `edit_file` | Search/replace edits on existing files | Medium | — |
| `write_file` | Create or overwrite files | Dangerous | — |
| `execute_command` | Execute commands in the detected shell (cross-platform). Output truncated at 32KB. | Most Dangerous | — |
| `search_content` | Search file contents using ripgrep (`rg`). 100 matching lines by default. | Safe | Requires `rg` binary |

Each tool is implemented with type-safe input structs and auto-generated JSON schemas. All tools accept a `context.Context` parameter and respect cancellation — `:cancel` will interrupt long-running tool execution. See [schema-improvements.md](schema-improvements.md) for the pattern.

The `search_content` tool is conditionally registered — it is only available when the `rg` binary is found on the system `PATH` at startup. When available, the system prompt includes a `SEARCH:` section instructing the LLM to prefer `search_content` over reading files chunk by chunk to locate code, definitions, usages, and patterns.

#### Shell Detection (`internal/tools/shell/`)

The `execute_command` tool uses a cross-platform shell detection system. On startup, it probes the OS environment for an available shell and selects the best candidate.

**Detection order:**

1. `ALAYACORE_SHELL` environment variable (matched against known shells; unknown values are ignored)
2. OS-specific `knownShells` list tried in preference order (guaranteed to succeed — `sh` on Unix, `cmd` on Windows)

**Supported shells:**

| Shell | Binary | OS | Invocation | Notes |
|-------|--------|----|------------|-------|
| Bash | `bash` | Unix | `bash -c <cmd>` | Preferred on Unix; LLMs naturally write bash syntax |
| Zsh | `zsh` | Unix | `zsh -c <cmd>` | Second choice on Unix |
| POSIX sh | `sh` | Unix | `sh -c <cmd>` | Guaranteed on all POSIX systems |
| PowerShell Core | `pwsh` | Windows | `pwsh -NoLogo -NonInteractive -Command <cmd>` | Preferred on Windows |
| Windows PowerShell | `powershell` | Windows | `powershell -NoLogo -NonInteractive -Command <cmd>` | Ships with Windows |
| cmd | `cmd` | Windows | `cmd /c <cmd>` | Guaranteed on all Windows machines |

The tool description (shown to the LLM) is dynamically generated based on the detected shell so the LLM uses the correct syntax. Platform-specific process isolation is handled per-OS:

- **Unix**: `setsid` creates a new session; `SIGINT` → `SIGKILL` for cancellation
- **Windows**: `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` isolates the child; `process.Kill()` for cancellation

The package uses Go build tags (`//go:build !windows` / `//go:build windows`) for all OS-specific code.

## TLV Protocol

Communication between adaptors and session uses a simple Tag-Length-Value (TLV) binary protocol.

### Message Format

```
[2-byte tag][4-byte length (big-endian)][value bytes]
```

### Delta Messages

TA, TR, and FS are **delta messages** — they arrive piece-by-piece during
streaming and carry a NUL-delimited stream ID in the value:

```
\x00<stream-id>\x00<content>
```

NUL bytes (`\x00`) are used as delimiters because they can never appear in
normal UTF-8 text, making the split unambiguous even if the LLM generates
content that looks like a stream ID.

Stream ID formats differ by tag:

- **TA, TR** — `<promptID>-<step>-<suffix>` where suffix is `t` (text) or `r` (reasoning).
  Example: `\x000-1-t\x00Hello world`

- **FS** — free-form tool call ID assigned by the LLM provider (e.g. `call_abc123`).
  Example: `\x00call_abc123\x00pending`

### Tags

| Tag | Code | Direction | Description |
|-----|------|-----------|-------------|
| `TagTextUser` | TU | Input | User text input |
| `TagTextAssistant` | TA | Output | Assistant text output |
| `TagTextReasoning` | TR | Output | Reasoning/thinking content |
| `TagFunctionCall` | FC | Output | Function call for persistence |
| `TagFunctionResult` | FR | Output | Function result for persistence |
| `TagFunctionState` | FS | Output | Function state indicator (pending/success/error) |
| `TagSystemError` | SE | Output | System error messages |
| `TagSystemNotify` | SN | Output | System notifications |
| `TagSystemData` | SD | Output | System data (JSON) |

### Example Flow

```
1. User types "read main.go" in terminal
2. Terminal adaptor emits: TLV(TU, "read main.go")
3. Session reads TLV, creates UserPrompt task
4. Session processes prompt through the agent loop
5. Agent calls read_file tool → Session emits: TLV(FS, "\x00tool123\x00pending") → TLV(FS, "\x00tool123\x00success")
6. Agent generates response → Session emits: TLV(TA, "\x000-0-t\x00Here's what main.go does...")
7. Terminal adaptor parses TLV, renders styled content in windows
```

## Cross-Platform Architecture

AlayaCore uses Go build tags for all OS-specific code. The only platform-dependent subsystem is shell execution, isolated in the `internal/tools/shell/` package:

| File | Build tag | Provides |
|------|-----------|----------|
| `shell.go` | *(all)* | `Shell` type, `Detect()`, `detect()` |
| `shell_unix.go` | `!windows` | Unix shell defs (`bash`, `zsh`, `sh`), `knownShells` |
| `shell_windows.go` | `windows` | Windows shell defs (`pwsh`, `powershell`, `cmd`), `knownShells` |
| `exec_unix.go` | `!windows` | `SetDetachFlags` (setsid), `OpenDevNull` (/dev/null), `AssignJob` (no-op), `ClearJob` (no-op) |
| `exec_windows.go` | `windows` | `SetDetachFlags` (CREATE_NO_WINDOW + CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP), `OpenDevNull` (NUL) |
| `terminate_unix.go` | `!windows` | `TerminateProcessGroup` (SIGINT → SIGKILL) |
| `terminate_windows.go` | `windows` | `Job` type, `AssignJob`, `ClearJob`, `TerminateProcessGroup` (Job Object → taskkill /F /T → Kill) |

All other packages (LLM providers, session management, TLV protocol, skills, schema generation) are pure Go with no OS-specific code.

## System Prompt Architecture

The system prompt is sent as **separate messages** (not a single concatenated string):

```
System Message 1: Default Prompt (identity + rules + search preferences)
                  + Skills section (only when skills configured)
                  + Current working directory

System Message 2: Extra System Prompt (from --system flag, repeatable)
```

When `rg` is available, the default prompt includes a `SEARCH:` section that instructs the LLM to prefer the `search_content` tool for locating content over reading files chunk by chunk. This section is omitted when `rg` is not installed.

When skill paths are provided via `--skill` and skills are discovered, the prompt includes instructions for reading skill `SKILL.md` files from their `<location>`, followed by an `<available_skills>` XML fragment listing each skill's name, description, and location. Both are omitted entirely when no skills are configured.

Both providers (`openai`, `anthropic`) send these as two independent system
messages. The default prompt and extra prompt are kept separate so the LLM API
can cache them independently.

### Current Working Directory

The current working directory is appended to the end of System Message 1. This
placement has two benefits:

1. **Absolute path anchoring** — LLMs use the CWD to construct correct absolute
   paths from the first tool call onward, rather than guessing or assembling
   paths incorrectly. Empirical testing shows that without the CWD, LLMs still
   use absolute paths but occasionally construct them with the wrong base
   directory, wasting steps.

2. **Cache reuse** — The stable portion of the system prompt (identity, rules,
   skills) remains identical across sessions and can be served from the API
   cache. Only the CWD suffix changes between projects, minimizing cache misses.

The CWD is **not** persisted in the session file. On session load, it is
rebuilt from the current runtime environment, ensuring the LLM always sees the
correct base directory for the current session.

For Anthropic APIs with `prompt_cache: true`, a top-level `cache_control: {"type": "ephemeral"}` is added to the request body for automatic prompt caching.

## Data Flow

### Startup Flow

```
main.go → config.Parse() → Settings
                ↓
        app.Setup(Settings)
                ↓
        ├── skills.NewManager(skillPaths)
        ├── tools.NewReadFileTool(), etc.
        ├── tools.RGAvailable() → conditionally register search_content tool
        └── Build system prompt (with SEARCH section if rg available)
                ↓
        terminal.NewAdaptor(appConfig)  or  plainio.NewAdaptor(appConfig)
                ↓
        Session created with tools and system prompt
```

### User Prompt Flow

```
User types prompt
  → InputModel captures input
    → Emit TLV(TU, prompt)
      → Session.readFromInput()
        → submitTask(UserPrompt)
          → Task Queue
            → taskRunner()
              → handleUserPrompt()
                → processPrompt()
                  → Agent.Stream()
                    → Callbacks emit TLV(TA), TLV(TR), TLV(FS), etc.
                      → OutputWriter parses TLV
                        → WindowBuffer.AppendOrUpdate()
                          → DisplayModel.View()
                            → Terminal renders output
```

### Tool Execution Flow

```
Agent.Stream() receives tool_call event
  → OnToolCall callback → TLV(FS, "\x00<id>\x00pending") → UI shows tool indicator
    → Agent executes tool: tool.Execute(ctx, input)
      → OnToolResult callback → TLV(FS, "\x00<id>\x00success") → UI updates indicator
        → Tool result added to messages
          → Agent continues to next step (if under max_steps)
```

## Design Decisions

1. **TLV Protocol** — Simple binary protocol for clean separation between adaptors and session. Both the TUI and plain-IO mode share all session/agent logic.
2. **Task Queue** — Deferred task processing with cancellation support. Queued tasks execute sequentially.
3. **Virtual Scrolling** — Only visible windows are rendered. 3.5x faster than naive rendering. See [virtual-rendering-performance.md](virtual-rendering-performance.md).
4. **Domain Errors** — Structured error types with operation context for consistent error handling. See [error-handling.md](error-handling.md).
5. **Command Registry** — Declarative command registration for extensibility.
6. **Interface Abstraction** — OutputWriter interface for testability.
7. **Provider Factory** — Decoupled provider creation from session logic.
8. **Typed Tools** — `TypedExecute[T]` wrapper for type-safe tool implementations with auto-generated schemas.
9. **Lazy Agent Init** — Agent and provider are created on first use, not at startup.
10. **Sequential Tool Execution** — Tools execute one at a time. See [sequential-tool-execution.md](sequential-tool-execution.md).
11. **Context Efficiency** — Tool descriptions are minimal, outputs are size-capped (32KB), search results limited (100 lines), and old tool results are compacted to save tokens. See [context-tracking.md](context-tracking.md).
12. **Think Mode** — Provider-specific reasoning fields are added to API requests. Three levels: 0=off, 1=normal, 2=max. Toggled via `:think [0|1|2]`.

## Gotchas

Non-obvious patterns that have caused bugs. Read carefully when modifying related code.

### Agent step messages must not be reconstructed

The provider's `StepCompleteEvent.Messages` contains the complete assistant message — text, reasoning, and tool calls all together. The agent must use these messages as-is, not reconstruct a new message from just the tool calls. Reconstruction loses text content that the LLM returned alongside tool calls. See `agent.go` → `processStreamEvents`.

### Sentinel values must never be overwritten

`WindowBuffer.dirtyIndex` uses a sentinel (`dirtyFullRebuild = -2`) to signal that all windows need recalculation. State transitions must check whether the sentinel is already set before overwriting — an `else` branch that blindly assigns a new index can downgrade a full-rebuild to a single-window update, silently dropping windows from the display. See `window.go` → `markDirty`.

### Mutex deadlock in SwitchModel

Don't hold a mutex while calling methods that may need the same mutex.

```
❌ lock → update fields → call method (needs lock) → deadlock
✅ lock → update fields → unlock → call method
```

### OpenAI tool call chunking

Tool arguments arrive in chunks across multiple delta events:
- First chunk: has `id` and `name`
- Subsequent chunks: `id: ""` but correct `index`
- **Must use `index` (not `id`) to associate chunks** — see `openAIStreamState.appendToolCallArgs()`
- When sending back in history, arguments must be JSON-string (not raw JSON) — see `openaiConvertToolCalls()`

### Null arguments in tool call chunks

Some providers emit no-op deltas with `"arguments": null` (JSON literal null):

```json
{
	"choices": [{
		"delta": {
			"tool_calls": [{
				"function": {"arguments": null},
				"id": "",
				"index": 0,
				"type": "function"
			}]
		},
		"index": 0
	}]
}
```

After `json.Unmarshal` into `json.RawMessage`, `args` becomes the 4 bytes `null`. Since `args[0]` is `'n'` (not `'"'`), it bypasses the unquote path and falls through to the raw append. Without a guard, the accumulated arguments become e.g. `{"path": "README.md"}null` — corrupting the JSON and causing tool execution to fail.

**Fix:** skip chunks where `string(args) == "null"`. Safe because the `arguments` field is always a JSON string type in the OpenAI API spec, so the only time `args[0] != '"'` is for the null literal. See `openAIStreamState.appendToolCallArgs()`.

### Anthropic prompt caching

- System message must be ≥1024 tokens for caching to activate
- Uses **automatic caching**: top-level `cache_control: {"type": "ephemeral"}` on the request body
- Enabled per-model via `prompt_cache: true` in `model.conf` (other providers ignore)
- Best for multi-turn conversations where growing message history should be cached automatically

### Terminal scroll position

`DisplayModel.autoFollow` must be set to `false` for K (line scroll up) and Ctrl+D/Ctrl+U (half-page scroll) via `MarkUserScrolled()`, not just k/g/H/M (cursor move via `MoveWindowCursorUp`/`SetWindowCursor`/`MoveWindowCursorToTop`/`MoveWindowCursorToCenter`), or auto-follow is not properly disabled on manual scrolling. When auto-follow is active, j, J, and L are no-ops (cursor already at last window, viewport already at bottom) and do not disable auto-follow. Only `G` (`SetCursorToLastWindow`) re-enables it. See `window.go` → `MarkUserScrolled`.

### Incomplete tool calls on cancel

When user cancels mid-tool-call, messages may have `tool_use` without matching `tool_result`. `cleanIncompleteToolCalls()` removes these to prevent API errors on next request.

### Tool result message ordering

`OnStepFinish` callback receives complete step messages. For tool-using steps, this includes both the assistant message (with tool calls) AND the tool result message. The `OnToolResult` callback should only send UI notifications, not append to session messages — the agent loop handles message assembly.

### ANSI escape sequences are not recursive

When styling text with lipgloss, each segment must be rendered individually before concatenation. You cannot render a string that already contains ANSI codes with a new style and expect it to work.

### Think mode and reasoning_content

When think mode is set via `:think [0|1|2]`, each provider sends explicit thinking configuration in API requests. The key differences are:

1. A top-level **`thinking`** field (`{"type": "enabled"}` or `{"type": "disabled"}`) controls whether reasoning is active.
2. When think mode is on (level 1 or 2), assistant messages that only contain tool calls must still include an **empty reasoning block** (required by DeepSeek and similar providers).

| Provider | Level 1 (normal) | Level 2 (max) | Disabled |
|----------|------------------|---------------|----------|
| **Anthropic** | `"thinking": {"type": "enabled"}`, `"output_config": {"effort": "high"}` | `"thinking": {"type": "enabled"}`, `"output_config": {"effort": "max"}` | `"thinking": {"type": "disabled"}` |
| **OpenAI-compatible** | `"thinking": {"type": "enabled"}`, `"reasoning_effort": "high"` | `"thinking": {"type": "enabled"}`, `"reasoning_effort": "xhigh"` | `"thinking": {"type": "disabled"}` |

> **Note:** The OpenAI-compatible thinking/reasoning parameters (`thinking`, `reasoning_effort`, `reasoning_content`) are not part of the official OpenAI API standard. They originate from [DeepSeek's thinking mode documentation](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/thinking_mode) and are supported by **DeepSeek**, **GLM**, and **MiniMax**. Other providers silently ignore unknown fields.

#### OpenAI-compatible — request examples

When think mode is **disabled**, assistant messages contain only the tool calls — no `reasoning_content` field:

```json
{
	"messages": [

		...

		{
			"role": "assistant",
			"tool_calls": [{
				"function": {
					"arguments": "{\"path\":\"/home/wallace/playground/alayacore/go.mod\",\"end_line\":5}",
					"name": "read_file"
				},
				"id": "call_ca6eef24512147a6a9dae7bd",
				"index": 0,
				"type": "function"
			}]
		},

		...

	],

	"model": "deepseek-v4-flash",

	"thinking": { "type": "disabled" },

	...
}
```

When think mode is **enabled**, every assistant message is padded with `"reasoning_content": ""` even when there is no actual reasoning text, and the request includes `reasoning_effort`:

```json
{
	"messages": [

		...

		{
			"role": "assistant",
			"reasoning_content": "",
			"tool_calls": [{
				"function": {
					"arguments": "{\"path\":\"/home/wallace/playground/alayacore/go.mod\",\"end_line\":5}",
					"name": "read_file"
				},
				"id": "call_ca6eef24512147a6a9dae7bd",
				"index": 0,
				"type": "function"
			}]
		},

		...

	],

	"model": "deepseek-v4-flash",

	"thinking": { "type": "enabled" },
	"reasoning_effort": "xhigh",

	...
}
```

#### Anthropic-compatible — request examples

When think mode is **disabled**, assistant messages contain only the tool-use content block — no `thinking` block:

```json
{
	"messages": [

		...

		{
			"role": "assistant",
			"content": [
				{
					"id": "call_ca6eef24512147a6a9dae7bd",
					"input": {
						"end_line": 5,
						"path": "/home/wallace/playground/alayacore/go.mod"
					},
					"name": "read_file",
					"type": "tool_use"
				}
			]
		},

		...

	],

	"model": "deepseek-v4-pro",

	"thinking": { "type": "disabled" },

	...
}
```

When think mode is **enabled**, every assistant message is padded with an empty `{"type": "thinking", "thinking": ""}` block when none is present, and the request includes `output_config`:

```json
{
	"messages": [

		...

		{
			"role": "assistant",
			"content": [
				{
					"id": "call_ca6eef24512147a6a9dae7bd",
					"input": {
						"end_line": 5,
						"path": "/home/wallace/playground/alayacore/go.mod"
					},
					"name": "read_file",
					"type": "tool_use"
				},
				{
					"thinking": "",
					"type": "thinking"
				}
			]
		},

		...

	],

	"model": "deepseek-v4-pro",

	"thinking": { "type": "enabled" },
	"output_config": { "effort": "max" },

	...
}
```

Some OpenAI-compatible providers (e.g. DeepSeek) return `reasoning_content` in assistant responses. Per [DeepSeek's documentation](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/thinking_mode):

> Between two user messages, if the model performed a tool call, the intermediate assistant's `reasoning_content` must participate in the context concatenation and must be passed back to the API in all subsequent user interaction turns.

This means **all** intermediate assistant messages in a multi-turn tool call chain must include their `reasoning_content`. Dropping it causes a 400 error from providers that require it.

#### Empty thinking block padding — implementation

Both providers pad assistant messages with an empty reasoning value — but **only when reasoning mode is enabled** — to avoid wasting input tokens when it isn't needed.

- **Anthropic provider** (`anthropicConvertMessages`): pads every assistant message with an empty `{"type": "thinking", "thinking": ""}` block when none is present.
- **OpenAI provider** (`openaiConvertMessages`): extracts reasoning text via `openaiExtractReasoning()` and sets `reasoning_content` on every assistant message — even as empty string when no reasoning text exists.

Both are conditional on reasoning mode being enabled. When think mode is off, no padding is added.
