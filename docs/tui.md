# Terminal UI

AlayaCore's terminal UI is built with [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) and [Lip Gloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss) and uses vim-like keybindings throughout.

## Multi-Modal Attachments

AlayaCore supports multi-modal input — attaching images, audio, video, or documents alongside text. Attachments are sent as TLV frames **before** the text frame, all within a single `TagUserEnd`-delimited message:

```
[TagUserI/V/A/D frames...] + [TagUserT text] + [TagUserEnd]
```

### Attachment Picker

Press `Ctrl+A` to open and toggle the attachment picker overlay. Two modes are available:

**Local Mode** (default):
Browse and select local files via a file browser with fuzzy search.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` | Toggle focus between path input and file list |
| `j`, `↓` | Move selection down |
| `k`, `↑` | Move selection up |
| `Enter` on dir | Enter directory |
| `Enter` on file | Add file as attachment and close |
| `Ctrl+A` | Switch to URL mode |
| `Esc` | Close picker without adding |

**URL Mode**:
Enter a remote URL to attach as an attachment.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Enter` | Add the URL as attachment and close |
| `Ctrl+A` | Switch to local mode |
| `Esc` | Close picker without adding |

The prompt prefix indicates the current mode: `F` for local, `U` for URL.

### Attachment Types

The attachment type is determined by file extension (or URL path extension):

| Type | Icon | TLV Tag | Extensions |
|------|------|---------|------------|
| Image | 📷 | `UI` | `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.bmp`, `.svg` |
| Video | 🎬 | `UV` | `.mp4`, `.mpeg`, `.mpg`, `.avi`, `.mov`, `.webm`, `.mkv` |
| Audio | 🎵 | `UA` | `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.ogg`, `.flac`, `.aac`, `.m4a`, `.wma` |
| Document | 📄 | `UD` | `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.md`, others / unknown |

### Display

Attachments appear above the text input, separated by `---`, matching the rendering of user messages in the conversation history:

```
┌───────────────────────────────┐
│ 📷 Image  🎵 Audio            │
│ ---                           │
│ what are these?               │
└───────────────────────────────┘
```

### Sending

When you press `Enter`:
- Local files are read, base64-encoded into `data:` URIs, and sent as TLV frames
- URLs are sent as-is (no fetching)
- Text is sent as a `TagUserT` frame
- A `TagUserEnd` frame finalizes the message

Attachments are cleared after sending. Use `Ctrl+C` to discard both text and pending attachments without sending.

## Session Commands

See [commands.md](commands.md) for the full list of session commands (`:save`, `:cancel`, `:fork`, etc.).

Note: `:quit` / `:q`, `:help`, and `:suspend` are handled directly by each adapter (terminal shows a confirmation dialog for quit, opens help window for help, suspends the process for suspend; plainio exits immediately for quit and help, and does not support suspend; rawio passes all commands through to the session since it doesn't interpret frame payloads) and never reaches the session command dispatch.

## Window Container

The display area organizes content into separate windows — one per message or tool call. Windows have synchronized widths and can be navigated independently.

### Tool Result Separator

`write_file` and `edit_file` windows insert a dimmed `OUTPUT:` label line between the tool call (showing the file path) and the tool result. This visually separates the content-heavy input from the output. Other tool windows (e.g. `read_file`, `execute_command`) don't use a separator — their call header is short and the result follows directly.

### Auto-Follow

Auto-follow is enabled by default at startup. When enabled, the viewport
automatically scrolls to keep the newest content visible as it arrives.

Auto-follow is disabled by any navigation that actually moves the cursor or
scrolls the viewport. While auto-follow is active:

| Key | Behavior | Disables auto-follow? |
|-----|----------|-----------------------|
| `G` | Follow the last window | ✅ Re-enables |
| `j` / `↓` | Move cursor down | ❌ No-op (race protection) |
| `L` | Move cursor to bottom | ❌ No-op (race protection) |
| `J` / `Shift+Down` | Scroll down one line | ❌ No-op when at bottom |
| `Ctrl+D` | Scroll down half screen | ❌ No-op when at bottom |
| `k` / `↑` | Move cursor up | ✅ If cursor actually moves |
| `H` | Move to top of visible area | ✅ If cursor actually moves |
| `M` | Move to center of visible area | ✅ If cursor actually moves |
| `f` | Jump to next user prompt | ✅ If cursor actually moves |
| `b` | Jump to previous user prompt | ✅ If cursor actually moves |
| `g` / `Home` | Go to first window | ✅ If cursor actually moves |
| `K` / `Shift+Up` | Scroll up one line | ✅ Always |
| `Ctrl+U` | Scroll up half screen | ✅ Always |
| `e` | Open in editor | ✅ Always |
| `Space` | Toggle window fold | ❌ Never |
| `Tab` | Toggle focus | ❌ Never |

### Fold Mode

Press `Space` on any window to collapse it — the window shows the first 2 lines, a centered fold indicator, and the last 2 lines. Press `Space` again to expand.

### Virtual Scrolling

The display uses virtual scrolling to handle large outputs efficiently. Only visible windows are rendered, giving a 4.4x speedup over naive rendering (see [performance analysis](internal/virtual-rendering-performance.md) for details).

### Sentinel values

`WindowBuffer.dirtyIndex` uses a sentinel (`dirtyFullRebuild = -2`) to signal that all windows need recalculation. State transitions must check whether the sentinel is already set before overwriting — an `else` branch that blindly assigns a new index can downgrade a full-rebuild to a single-window update, silently dropping windows from the display. See `window.go` → `markDirty`.

### ANSI escape sequences are not recursive

When styling text with lipgloss, each segment must be rendered individually before concatenation. You cannot render a string that already contains ANSI codes with a new style and expect it to work.


## Tool Confirm Dialog

When a tool requires confirmation (configured via `--tool-confirm`), a dialog overlay appears:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `y` | Allow the tool to run |
| `n`, `Esc` | Reject the tool |
| `e` | Open full tool input in external editor (view-only) |

The dialog shows the tool name in the title and a 2-line preview of the tool's input arguments. Press `e` to inspect the complete input in `$EDITOR` without closing the dialog.

## Line Wrapping

Content in each window is soft-wrapped to fit the available width. The wrapping is **character-boundary** — it breaks mid-word when a word exceeds the line width, matching how a typical terminal behaves.

Width calculation is **Unicode-aware**:

- ASCII / Latin characters occupy **1 cell**
- CJK characters (中文、日本語、한국어) occupy **2 cells**
- Emoji occupy **2 cells** (grapheme clusters per Unicode UAX #29)
- ANSI escape codes (colors, bold, etc.) occupy **0 cells**

When a newline is inserted by the wrapper, ANSI styles are automatically carried forward to the next line — a red-styled sentence stays red on continuation lines.

Incremental updates avoid re-wrapping the entire content on every token. Only the last line is combined with the new delta and re-wrapped, keeping per-token cost proportional to the delta size rather than total content.

## Help Window

Press `Ctrl+H` or type `:help` to open a help window listing all keybindings and commands. The filter input at the top lets you fuzzy-search for specific keys or commands (e.g. typing `gt` matches `:theme_set`):

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` | Toggle focus between filter input and list |
| `q`, `Esc` | Close help window |
| `j`, `↓` | Move selection down |
| `k`, `↑` | Move selection up |
| `Enter` | Copy selected command to input (commands only) |

The help window is organized into three sections:

- **Commands** — colon commands available in the input field (commands available in the input field)
- **Global Shortcuts** — keybindings that work from any context
- **Display Mode** — navigation and editing keys for the display area

The help window uses the same size, position, and overlay pattern as the model selector and theme selector.
