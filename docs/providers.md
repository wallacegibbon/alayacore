# Provider-Specific Gotchas

Non-obvious patterns when working with LLM provider implementations.

> **See also: [data-mapping.md](data-mapping.md)** for how OpenAI/Anthropic wire formats map to the domain types in `llm/types.go`, with traced examples of `reasoning_content`, `tool_calls`, and mixed messages.

## OpenAI tool call chunking

Tool arguments arrive in chunks across multiple delta events:
- First chunk: has `id` and `name`
- Subsequent chunks: `id: ""` but correct `index`
- **Must use `index` (not `id`) to associate chunks** — see `openAIStreamState.appendToolCallArgs()`
- When sending back in history, arguments must be JSON-string (not raw JSON) — see `openaiConvertToolCalls()`

## Null arguments in tool call chunks

Some providers emit no-op deltas with `"arguments": null` (JSON literal null):

```json
{
	"choices": [{
		"delta": {
			"tool_calls": [{
				"function": {"arguments": null},
				"id": "",
				"index": 0,
				"type": "function"
			}]
		},
		"index": 0
	}]
}
```

After `json.Unmarshal` into `json.RawMessage`, `args` becomes the 4 bytes `null`. Since `args[0]` is `'n'` (not `'"'`), it bypasses the unquote path and falls through to the raw append. Without a guard, the accumulated arguments become e.g. `{"path": "README.md"}null` — corrupting the JSON and causing tool execution to fail.

**Fix:** skip chunks where `string(args) == "null"`. Safe because the `arguments` field is always a JSON string type in the OpenAI API spec, so the only time `args[0] != '"'` is for the null literal. See `openAIStreamState.appendToolCallArgs()`.

## Reasoning mode and reasoning_content

When reasoning mode is set via `:reason [0|1|2]`, each provider sends explicit thinking configuration in API requests. The key differences are:

1. A top-level **`thinking`** field (`{"type": "enabled"}` or `{"type": "disabled"}`) controls whether reasoning is active. This is always set explicitly — even when reasoning is off — because some providers (e.g. DeepSeek V4) default to thinking enabled. Omitting the field would leave thinking on at the API level, contradicting the UI state.
2. When reasoning mode is on (level 1 or 2), assistant messages that only contain tool calls must still include an **empty reasoning block** (required by DeepSeek and similar providers).

| Provider | Level 1 (normal) | Level 2 (max) | Disabled |
|----------|------------------|---------------|----------|
| **Anthropic** | `"thinking": {"type": "enabled"}`, `"output_config": {"effort": "high"}` | `"thinking": {"type": "enabled"}`, `"output_config": {"effort": "max"}` | `"thinking": {"type": "disabled"}` |
| **OpenAI-compatible** | `"thinking": {"type": "enabled"}`, `"reasoning_effort": "high"` | `"thinking": {"type": "enabled"}`, `"reasoning_effort": "xhigh"` | `"thinking": {"type": "disabled"}` |

> **Note:** The OpenAI-compatible thinking/reasoning parameters (`thinking`, `reasoning_effort`, `reasoning_content`) are not part of the official OpenAI API standard. They originate from [DeepSeek's thinking mode documentation](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/thinking_mode) and are supported by **DeepSeek**, **GLM**, and **MiniMax**. Other providers silently ignore unknown fields.

### OpenAI-compatible — request examples

When reasoning mode is **disabled**, assistant messages contain only the tool calls — no `reasoning_content` field:

```json
{
	"messages": [

		...

		{
			"role": "assistant",
			"tool_calls": [{
				"function": {
					"arguments": "{\"path\":\"/home/wallace/playground/alayacore/go.mod\",\"end_line\":5}",
					"name": "read_file"
				},
				"id": "call_ca6eef24512147a6a9dae7bd",
				"index": 0,
				"type": "function"
			}]
		},

		...

	],

	"model": "deepseek-v4-flash",

	"thinking": { "type": "disabled" },

	...
}
```

When reasoning mode is **enabled**, every assistant message is padded with `"reasoning_content": ""` even when there is no actual reasoning text, and the request includes `reasoning_effort`:

```json
{
	"messages": [

		...

		{
			"role": "assistant",
			"reasoning_content": "",
			"tool_calls": [{
				"function": {
					"arguments": "{\"path\":\"/home/wallace/playground/alayacore/go.mod\",\"end_line\":5}",
					"name": "read_file"
				},
				"id": "call_ca6eef24512147a6a9dae7bd",
				"index": 0,
				"type": "function"
			}]
		},

		...

	],

	"model": "deepseek-v4-flash",

	"thinking": { "type": "enabled" },
	"reasoning_effort": "xhigh",

	...
}
```

### Anthropic-compatible — request examples

When reasoning mode is **disabled**, assistant messages contain only the tool-use content block — no `thinking` block:

```json
{
	"messages": [

		...

		{
			"role": "assistant",
			"content": [
				{
					"id": "call_ca6eef24512147a6a9dae7bd",
					"input": {
						"end_line": 5,
						"path": "/home/wallace/playground/alayacore/go.mod"
					},
					"name": "read_file",
					"type": "tool_use"
				}
			]
		},

		...

	],

	"model": "deepseek-v4-pro",

	"thinking": { "type": "disabled" },

	...
}
```

When reasoning mode is **enabled**, every assistant message is prepended with an empty `{"type": "thinking", "thinking": ""}` block when none is present, and the request includes `output_config`:

```json
{
	"messages": [

		...

		{
			"role": "assistant",
			"content": [
				{
					"thinking": "",
					"type": "thinking"
				},
				{
					"id": "call_ca6eef24512147a6a9dae7bd",
					"input": {
						"end_line": 5,
						"path": "/home/wallace/playground/alayacore/go.mod"
					},
					"name": "read_file",
					"type": "tool_use"
				}
			]
		},

		...

	],

	"model": "deepseek-v4-pro",

	"thinking": { "type": "enabled" },
	"output_config": { "effort": "max" },

	...
}
```

Some OpenAI-compatible providers (e.g. DeepSeek) return `reasoning_content` in assistant responses. Per [DeepSeek's documentation](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/thinking_mode):

> Between two user messages, if the model performed a tool call, the intermediate assistant's `reasoning_content` must participate in the context concatenation and must be passed back to the API in all subsequent user interaction turns.

This means **all** intermediate assistant messages in a multi-turn tool call chain must include their `reasoning_content`. Dropping it causes a 400 error from providers that require it.

### Empty reasoning block padding — implementation

Both providers pad assistant messages with an empty reasoning value — but **only when reasoning mode is enabled** — to avoid wasting input tokens when it isn't needed.

- **Anthropic provider** (`anthropicConvertMessages`): prepends an empty `{"type": "thinking", "thinking": ""}` block to every assistant message that lacks one. The thinking block must come first per Anthropic's API.
- **OpenAI provider** (`openaiConvertMessages`): extracts reasoning text via `openaiExtractReasoning()` and sets `reasoning_content` on every assistant message — even as empty string when no reasoning text exists.

Both are conditional on reasoning mode being enabled. When reasoning mode is off, no padding is added.
